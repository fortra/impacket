# Description:
#   Simple ICMP ping.
#
#   This implementation of ping uses the ICMP echo and echo-reply packets
#   to check the status of a host. If the remote host is up, it should reply
#   to the echo probe with an echo-reply packet.
#   Note that this isn't a definite test, as in the case the remote host is up
#   but refuses to reply the probes.
#   Also note that the user must have special access to be able to open a raw
#   socket, which this program requires.
