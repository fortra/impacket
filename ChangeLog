February 2014: 0.9.11:
1) New RPC and NDR runtime (located at impacket.dcerpc.v5, old one still available):
  a. Support marshaling/unmarshaling for NDR20 and NDR64
  b. Support for RPC_C_AUTHN_NETLOGON
  c. The following interface were developed based on its standard definition:
    * [MS-LSAD] - Local Security Authority (Domain Policy) Remote Protocol (lsad.py)
    * [MS-LSAT] - Local Security Authority (Translation Methods) Remote Protocol (lsat.py)
    * [MS-NRPC] - Netlogon Remote Protocol (nrpc.py) 
    * [MS-RRP] - Windows Remote Registry Protocol (rrp.py)
    * [MS-SAMR] - Security Account Manager (SAM) Remote Protocol (samr.py)
    * [MS-SCMR] - Service Control Manager Remote Protocol (scmr.py)
    * [MS-SRVS] - Server Service Remote Protocol (srvs.py) 
    * [MS-WKST] - Workstation Service Remote Protocol (wkst.py) 
    * [MS-RPCE]-C706 -  Remote Procedure Call Protocol Extensions (epm.py)
    * [MS-DTYP] - Windows Data Types (dtypes.py)
    Most of the DCE Calls have helper functions for easier use. Test cases added for 
    all calls (check the test cases directory)
2) ESE parser (Extensive Storage Engine) (ese.py)
3) Windows Registry parser (winregistry.py)
4) TDS protocol now supports SSL, can be used from mssqlclient
5) Support for EAPOL, EAP and WPS decoders
6) VLAN tagging (IEEE 802.1Q and 802.1ad) support for ImpactPacket, done by dan.pisi
8) New examples:
   * rdp_check.py: tests whether an account (pwd or hashes) is valid against an RDP server
   * esentutl.py: ESE example to show how to interact with ESE databases (e.g. NTDS.dit)
   * ntfs-read.py: mini shell for browsing an NTFS volume
   * registry-read.py: Windows offline registry reader
   * secretsdump.py: agent-less remote windows secrets dump (SAM, LSA, CDC, NTDS)

March 2013: 0.9.10:
1) SMB version 2 and 3 protocol support ([MS-SMB2]). Signing supported, encryption for SMB3 still pending.
2) Added a SMBConnection layer on top of each SMB specific protocol. Much simpler and SMB version independent.  It will pick the best SMB Version when connecting against the target. Check smbconnection.py for a list of available methods across all the protocols.
3) Partial TDS implementation ([MS-TDS] & [MC-SQLR]) so we could talk with MSSQL Servers.
4) Unicode support for the smbserver. Newer OSX won't connect to a non unicode SMB Server.
5) DCERPC Endpoints' new calls:
  a. EPM: lookup(): It can work as a general portmapper, or just to find specific interfaces/objects.
6) New examples:
  a. mssqlclient.py: A MS SQL client, allowing to do MS SQL or Windows Authentication (accepts hashes) and then gives you an SQL prompt for your pleasure.
  b. mssqlinstance.py: Lists the MS SQL instances running on a target machine.
  c. rpcdump.py: Output changed. Hopefully more useful. Parsed all the Windows Protocol Specification looking for the UUIDs used and that information is included as well. This could be helpful when reading a portmap output and to develop new functionality to interact against a target interface.
  d. smbexec.py: Another alternative to psexec. Less capabilities but might work on tight AV environments. Based on the technique described at http://www.accuvant.com/blog/2012/11/13/owning-computers-without-shell-access. It also supports instantiating a local smbserver to receive the output of the commandos executed for those situations where no share is available on the other end. 
  e. smbrelayx.py: It now also listens on port 80 and forwards/reflects the credentials accordingly.

And finally tons of fixes :).

July 2012: 0.9.9:
1) Added 802.11 packets encoding/decoding
2) Addition of support for IP6, ICMP6 and NDP packets. Addition of IP6_Address helper class.
3) SMB/DCERPC:
  a. GSS-API/SPNEGO Support.
  b. SPN support in auth blob.
  c. NTLM2 and NTLMv2 support.
  d. Default SMB port now 445. If *SMBSERVER is specified the library will try to resolve the netbios name.
  e. Pass the hash supported for SMB/DCE-RPC.
  f. IPv6 support for SMB/NMB/DCERPC.
  g. DOMAIN support for authentication. 
  h. SMB signing support when server enforces it.
  i. DCERPC signing/sealing for all NTLM flavours.
  j. DCERPC transport now accepts an already established SMB connection.
  k. Basic SMBServer implementation in Python. It allows third-party DCE-RPC servers to handle DCERPC Request (by forwarding named pipes requests).
  l. Minimalistic SRVSVC dcerpc server to be used by SMBServer in order to avoidg Windows 7 nasty bug when that pipe's not functional.

4) DCERPC Endpoints' new calls:
  a. SRVSVC: NetrShareEnum(Level1), NetrShareGetInfo(Level2), NetrServerGetInfo(Level2), NetrRemoteTOD(), NetprNameCanonicalize().
  b. SVCCTL: CloseServiceHandle(), OpenSCManagerW(), CreateServiceW(), StartServiceW(), OpenServiceW(), OpenServiceA(), StopService(), DeleteService(), EnumServicesStatusW(), QueryServiceStatus(), QueryServiceConfigW().
  c. WKSSVC: NetrWkstaTransportEnum().
  d. SAMR: OpenAlias(), GetMembersInAlias().
  e. LSARPC: LsarOpenPolicy2(), LsarLookupSids(), LsarClose().

5) New examples:
  a. ifmap.py: First, this binds to the MGMT interface and gets a list of interface IDs. It adds to this a large list of interface UUIDs seen in the wild. It then tries to bind to each interface and reports whether the interface is listed and/or listening.
  b. lookupsid.py: DCE/RPC lookup sid brute forcer example.
  c. opdump.py: This binds to the given hostname:port and DCERPC interface. Then, it tries to call each of the first 256 operation numbers in turn and reports the outcome of each call.
  d. services.py: SVCCTL services common functions for manipulating services (START/STOP/DELETE/STATUS/CONFIG/LIST).
  e. test_wkssvc: DCE/RPC WKSSVC examples, playing with the functions Implemented.
  f. smbrelayx: Passes credentials to a third party server when doing MiTM.
  g. smbserver: Multiprocess/threading smbserver supporting common file server functions. Authentication all done but not enforced. Tested under Windows, Linux and MacOS clients.
  h. smbclient.py: now supports history, new commands also added.
  i. psexec.py: Execute remote commands on Windows machines
