What is Impacket?
=================

Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network
protocols. Impacket is mostly focused on providing low-level
programmatic access to the packets, however some protocols (for
instance NMB and SMB) are implemented in a higher level as a
foundation for other protocols. Packets can be constructed from
scratch, as well as parsed from raw data, and the object oriented API
makes it simple to work with deep hierarchies of protocols.

Impacket is most useful when used together with a packet capture
utility or package such as Pcapy, an object oriented Python extension
for capturing network packets.

What protocols are featured?
----------------------------

 * Ethernet, Linux ``Cooked'' capture.
 * IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP, ARP. (IPv4 and IPv6)
 * NMB and SMB1/2/3 (high-level implementations).
 * DCE/RPC versions 4 and 5, over different transports: UDP (version 4
   exclusively), TCP, SMB/TCP, SMB/NetBIOS and HTTP.
 * Portions of the following DCE/RPC interfaces: Conv, DCOM, EPM,
   SAMR, SCMR, RRP, SRVSC, LSAD, LSAT, WKST, NRPC.


Getting Impacket
================

Current and past releases are available from
http://corelabs.coresecurity.com/index.php?module=Wiki&action=view&type=tool&name=Impacket
Trunk available from
http://code.google.com/p/impacket/

Setup
=====

Quick start
-----------

Grab the latest stable release, unpack it and run 'python setup.py
install' from the directory where you placed it. Isn't that easy?


Requirements
============

 * A Python interpreter. Versions 2.0.1 and newer are known to work. 
   a) If you want to run the examples and you have Python < 2.7, you
      will need to install argparse package for them to work.
   b) For cryptographic operations you will need pycrypto package
   c) For some examples you will need pyOpenSSL (rdp_check.py)
   d) If you're under Windows, you will need pyReadline
 * A recent release of Impacket.

Installing
----------

In order to install the source execute the following command from the
directory where the Impacket's distribution has been unpacked: 'python
setup.py install'. This will install the classes into the default
Python's modules path; note that you might need special permissions to
write there. For more information on what commands and options are
available from setup.py, run 'python setup.py --help-commands'.
